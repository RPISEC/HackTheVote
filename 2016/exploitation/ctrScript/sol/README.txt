This challenge is a "browser" that can read very limited "html" pages with a custom scripting lang.

Basic outline of intended solution:
- File descriptors are used to indicate pages, and 2 is added to any entered on on the google page
    o Enter -2 to get fd 0, and have it interpret your input
- There is a hidden wikileaks page that can print the source of other pages, useful to get a sense of how it looks

- There is a heap leak with resizing a string in ctrscript. Setting it to an empty string will not write a null, and allow libc addresses to be printed.

- There is an off-by-one with a array of color tags, allowing a variable to be overwritten requiring that the variable hashmap be reset.
- This allows a normally prevented collision of the protected Library object (Note that the seed of the hash function changes each time the table is cleared.)
- Creating a function that collides with Library allows a "type confusion" of sorts, and where it treats it as an array of pointers. This lets you control a function pointer that you can call
- Call your function pointer and ROP home to victory

The bug for this is found in the view_return function at the end. The function takes in user input via the insecure
gets() function. Overflowing the buffer allows control of EIP.

At this point there are a few options:

Option 1)
    ROP to get a shell on the server, then read the running binary for the flag (not really recommended/intended, but 
    that's really cool if you did that!)

Option 2)
    Jump to puts with the address of Trump's password (the flag)

Option 3)
    Dig around a bit more in your favorite dissassembler (as long as it's not Binja, rip) and notice that in the 
    function, add_return, if the user attempts to file more than 4 files (for a total of 5), then a pointer
    to the taxes struct is printed out. Then, overflow the unprotected gets(), and jump to view_return with the arguments
    being the leaked pointer and int 0 (to view Trump's tax return form). The flag is printed out.

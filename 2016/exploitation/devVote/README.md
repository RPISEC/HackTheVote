Nice job infowarrior, you are a true patriot. We are almost there. Now that we have access to the shadow government's admin server, we can extend to the real rigged voting machines and unrig them. Make sure to take some DNA Force(TM) to enhance your mitochondrial functions while you dig though the deep internals of these voting machines.

Our investigative team was able to find that the voting machines are open, and we can log into them. But I don't think that is enough. We need to root them to make sure they can't rig them again before the 8th.

Log into the vm system with `ssh vm@dev.vote.pwn.democrat` and credentials `vm:h4ckthevm`.

The credentials for the actual VM are `user:user`

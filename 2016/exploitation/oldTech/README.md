Alex Jones back again! You are a true patriot fighting for our general, Donald Trump. Now that we have gotten a foothold, it is time to put these globalists in their place. See that guy in the video? He is clearly rigging the election as we speak! What ever that website he has got there. That must be a weakspot, knowing how those liberals mishandle their tech, JUST like Crooked Hillary Clinton and her email servers. Did I mention how they got hacked? The globalist media keeps trying to hid that fact, but we know it will sink her in the end.

Anyway, what was I saying? Oh ya. You got to hack that webserver. Keep scouting with that IP camera, something must come up. They all suck at operation security, how else could Assange keep hacking them? Good luck, and don't forget to stay hydrated with your very own Alexapure Pro Water Filtration System (TM) to block out all the fluoride that is controlling your mind.

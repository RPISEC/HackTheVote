Trump is up quite a bit in Kansas, but with other historically red states (like Arizona) shifting sides, I think we can take this. Just takes a little voter fraud. Our target is the voter registration site, it looks like it is from the 90s, so it might be super vulnerable. If you can register a bunch of our people, we can bus them out and get them to vote for Clinton.

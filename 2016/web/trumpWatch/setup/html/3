<h2>The liberal cucks hacked me!</h2>

<p>Probably working with CTR, they couldn't stand our truth on the "free" internet. Probably scared that rigging the polls won't be enough with only a few weeks left before President Trump takes his rightful place.</p>
<p>They deleted almost everything I had, I was only able to recover two posts that I accidentally made backups of.</p>
<p>Well jokes on them, because like trump, I'm building a wall. Good luck hacking around this. I read all guides for good security, word for word. We now have military-grade encryption, and anti-hacker shields.</p>
<p>All your passwords sucked too, so now I'm making some new ones for you. These are the best password.</p>
<br/>
<p>I'll leave yall with one last quote from our God-Emperor, but expect regular content back ASAP.

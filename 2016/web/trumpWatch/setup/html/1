<h3>Even as a team they can't stump the trump!</h3>
<p>As a sad, desperate, last action, the two insignificant, non-god-emperor, candidates have decided to team up and combine their forces to try and match Trump's powerlevel.</p>
<p>Too bad for them, that they could barely measure up alone, and so combined they are still nothing compared to trump.</p>
<p>Lets see what our future president has to say about this:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, just announced that Lyin&#39; Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shows how weak and desperate Lyin&#39; Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can&#39;t stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.</p>&mdash; Donald J.

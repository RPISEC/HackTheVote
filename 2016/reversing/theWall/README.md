The Trump campaign is running a trial of The Wall plan. They want to prove that no illegal immigrants could get past it. If that goes as planned, us here at the DNC will have a hard time swinging some votes in the southern boarder states. We need you to hack system and get past the wall. I heard they have put extra protections into place, but we think you can still do it. If you do get into America, there should be a flag somewhere in the midwest that you can have. You will be US "citizen" after all.

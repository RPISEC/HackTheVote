You've been chosen to rig the ballots in favor of your candidate. You find the box, but it's locked with an indestructible padlock. Your only hope is to pick the lock! You'll need these tools to get the job done. Good luck ;)

Hint: I found these keys, but they still don't open the padlock :( These lockpicks are starting to seem pretty insignificant.
